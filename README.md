# High Seas v2

A faster, easier to use client for High Seas.

## Features

### Shipyard

The shipyard has better styling for YSWS ships, and the doubloons/hr you got on the ship!

Markdown rendering of the READMEs is also faster, looks better, and is more accurate.

The "Generate an idea" button is less buggy, faster (see a pattern here?) and provides objectively better ideas.

### Shop

The shop is a lot faster and shows more items at a time. It also shows you how many more doubloons you need for items you can't afford.

There is also a search bar and a filter for items that are out of stock.

Finally, there's a shop dialog that you can open by clicking on an item.

An enhanced purchase URL (`/api/buy?itemId={id}`) is also available that you can use to buy items.

### Miscellaneous

#### Better error page

Rather than a cryptic Vercel error, the error page provides some useful information and has better styling.
